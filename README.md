# Game Server

This is a simple rock-scissors-paper game server implemented in Java.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Java JDK 11 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2.5 or any other IDE that supports Java

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Build the project

## Built With

To build the project, run the `build.bat` script. This script compiles all Java files in the `src` directory and packages them into a JAR file named `GameServer.jar`.

## Running the server

To run the server, execute the `start.bat` script. This script runs the JAR file with the `java` command.
